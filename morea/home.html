  <hr />

  <p>Prerequisite:  Satisfactory completion of Japanese 301 with a “C” or better, or “CR”, or qualification by a placement test. All students with prior background taking language courses in the UH Manoa program for the first time and students returning from an exchange program in Japan, with the exceptions noted below, must take a regularly scheduled placement test. For continuing UHM students, a grade of “C” or better, or “CR” in the prerequisite course is required for continuation. To arrange for a placement test, please go to the following link: http://manoa.hawaii.edu/eall/placement-testing/ Taking the placement test is optional for students who have already earned prerequisite college credits for Japanese language at one of the UH campuses, including community colleges, or in the Konan or Obirin study abroad programs, with a grade of “C” or better, or “CR.” However, the placement test is strongly recommended if you are interested in taking advanced courses (300-400 level), if there has been a gap since your last language class, or if you would like a firmer sense of your proper placement.</p>

<h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>

<p>Japanese 302 Third-Year Japanese (4 credits) is the second half of a third-year course designed for students who have successfully completed Japanese language study up through the 301 level and are motivated to further their language skills.  Active development of all four skills still remains important in the course.  Classes will be conducted in Japanese, except in situations where instruction in English is deemed necessary.  Therefore, all students are expected to communicate in Japanese during class.  Class meets four times a week (MTWF), and regular class attendance and good participation and preparation for class are expected throughout the semester.  In addition, all students are required to work independently with the audio and video language materials on the (<a href="https://tobiraweb.9640.jp">Tobira website</a>).</p>
